# PharmacyDriver
This repository contains my Pharmacy Management System solution. I developed the user interface and business logic as a Windows Forms C# project and kept the source code inside the "Pharmacy Management System Solution" folder. This README explains what is in the repository, how the project is organized, and how to open and run it locally.

---

## Quick summary
I created a Pharmacy Management System as a Windows Forms application using C#. The project source files, forms, and assembly configuration live inside the "Pharmacy Management System Solution/Pharmacy Management System" folder. The code includes form classes for different parts of the application (admin views, homepage, category pages) and a small helper class for database interaction.

## Repository structure
Below I list the folders and key files I found. I list only items that are present and visible in the repository as I reviewed it.

- README.md
- Pharmacy Management System Solution/
  - Pharmacy Management System/
    - Admin_View_User.cs
    - Admin_File.cs
    - Admin_Dashboard.cs
    - BabyAndMomCare.cs
    - Homepage.cs
    - function.cs
    - Properties/
      - AssemblyInfo.cs
    - obj/
      - Debug/
        - Pharmacy Management System.csproj.FileListAbsolute.txt
        - (other build artifacts and resource caches)

Notes about these entries:
- All `.cs` files are C# source files and the file content indicates they are part of the `Pharmacy_Management_System` namespace and use Windows Forms (i.e., `using System.Windows.Forms;`).
- The `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` contains assembly metadata such as `AssemblyTitle` ("Pharmacy Management System") and assembly version info.
- The `obj/Debug` folder contains generated build artifacts and cache files (absolute file lists, resource caches, pdbs, etc.). These are generated by the build process and are not source files to edit.

## Brief description of the important files (as I found them)
I describe each relevant file by what I saw in the code:

- Admin_View_User.cs  
  - A Windows Form class (partial class) implementing the admin view for listing/viewing users. It references a `function` helper for data access.
- Admin_File.cs  
  - A simple internal class file (empty shell in the repository snapshot).
- Admin_Dashboard.cs  
  - A Windows Form class that appears to implement the admin dashboard UI and uses SqlClient for data operations.
- BabyAndMomCare.cs  
  - A Windows Form class likely representing a category or section in the application (based on the filename).
- Homepage.cs  
  - A Windows Form class that is likely the main entry or landing page for the application UI.
- function.cs  
  - A helper class that wraps database operations. I observed methods like `getConnection()`, `ReadData(string query)`, `getData(string query)` and `setData(string query, string msg)` which indicate this class is responsible for opening connections and running SQL queries.
- Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs  
  - Contains assembly attributes (title, product, version, GUID, etc.). I saw `AssemblyTitle("Pharmacy Management System")` and assembly version attributes.

## How to open, build and run
Based on the project type (C# Windows Forms source files present):

1. Prerequisites
   - Visual Studio (Community/Professional/Enterprise) — any recent version that supports Windows Forms/C# projects (Visual Studio 2017/2019/2022+ will work for typical Windows Forms projects).  
   - A suitable .NET Framework or .NET runtime that the project targets. The exact target framework is set in the project (.csproj) file — open the `.csproj` in Visual Studio or a text editor to confirm the targeted framework version.

2. Steps I follow locally
   - Clone the repository:
     - git clone https://github.com/rakib75464/PharmacyDriver.git
   - Open Visual Studio and choose "Open a project or solution".
   - Browse to the `Pharmacy Management System Solution` folder and open the solution (.sln) or the project file inside `Pharmacy Management System` if a solution file is not present in the same folder.
   - Build the solution (Build → Build Solution).
   - Run (Start Debugging or Start Without Debugging) to launch the Windows Forms application.

If Visual Studio warns about missing target frameworks or NuGet packages, follow the prompts to install the required components. If you need the exact target framework, check the `.csproj` file inside the project folder.

## Database / data notes (what I observed)
- The `function` helper class references `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, and `SqlDataReader` which indicates the application uses a SQL Server / ADO.NET connection for data access.  
Because database credentials and connection strings are sensitive, do not commit production credentials into source control. Use local configuration or environment variables and add a .gitignore entry for any local config files.

---

## Suggestions and housekeeping (what I'd do next)
- Add a `.gitignore` tailored for Visual Studio (to avoid committing bin/ and obj/ folders and user-specific files). Typical entries: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `*.pdb`, and other generated files.
- Remove (or re-create from clean sources) the `obj/Debug` tree from the repo if it was accidentally committed; those are build artifacts.
- If the project is intended to be shared, add a LICENSE file. I include a suggested license below; please choose or modify as you prefer.
- Add an `appsettings` or configuration sample (e.g., `app.config.example` or `README` section) documenting where to put the database connection string (so other developers can run the app locally).
- Add simple run/test instructions for common tasks (e.g., "How to seed sample data", if applicable).

## Contributing
If you or others want to contribute:
- Create feature branches from main (or master) and open pull requests.
- Use Visual Studio for changes to forms and designer files so the generated designer code stays consistent.
- Keep secrets (connection strings) out of the repository.
